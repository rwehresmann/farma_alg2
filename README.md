  * Before put your efforts in the reimplementation of some method, take a look if it's used somewhere;
  * A functionality is complex? Try make it simple. Still complex? Be sure to add a comment to help to understand what is happening;
  * Try give self-explanatory names to local variables;
  * In the code, english is the only language (comments, method names, variables, ...).
